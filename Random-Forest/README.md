# Random Forest Classifier for Demon Slayer Prediction

This project demonstrates the use of a Random Forest classifier to predict whether a character from the "Demon Slayer" anime is a demon slayer or not based on their attributes.

## Project Description

This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a character is a demon slayer based on their age, breathing style, and weapon type. The dataset is bootstrapped three times to create three different training sets, and the predictions from each model are aggregated to make a final prediction.
