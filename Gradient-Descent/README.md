# Simple Gradient Descent Implementation

This repository contains a simple implementation of a Gradient Descent using Python and NumPy. 

## Overview

The code demonstrates:
- Sigmoid activation function
- Cross-entropy loss calculation
- Gradient descent for weight and bias updates
- Training the neural network over multiple epochs

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone < github code link >
   ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

You can install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy
```
